# Eeyore

Eeyore is an end-of-round (EOR) assistant for Magic: The Gathering Judges. The goal is to make something as easy to use as PurpleFox.

Eeyore is in **very** early stages of development.

## Proposed features

* `/tables [list of table numbers]`: Creates a discrete embed for each table number. The list can be space- or comma-separated to tolerate different formatting.
* `/extension [table] [time]`: Adds the given extension to the given table.
* `/assign [table] [name]`: Assigns someone to watch a table.
